# Switch Challenge - HubHub
This is the final result of the switch challenged proposed. The follow README file contains a few informations about how the project was developed, and my experience with it.

## Running the project
Simply open the HTML file to see the final result! Also, remember to have the CSS file in the same directory so the styles can be applied.

## Why using the CDN?
The React official documentation suggests for me to use a framework so I can have routing, data fetching and more complex code organization. Of course, this is a gigantic overkill for this project. I thought about using the command `npx create-react-app`, but a few Google searches and I found out it was deprecated. With that, the simplest and most efficient way I found, was to use the CDN and a simple CSS file.

## Development proccess
The first thing I did was to read the first pages of the React official documentation. With that, I gained some basic understanding about components, props and states, which I decided it was enough for starting the project so I could learn along the way.

With all that, I created the initial structure with the help of blog posts and YouTube tutorials, making sure to make the switches bigger than the usual to facilitate the visualization. Most of the problems along the way were solved with the help of Stack Overflow and React documentation. I also used ChatGPT as my "individual teacher" to learn some concepts that I was struggling with, such as React Hooks and ReactDOM.

With everything working properly, I decided to add multiple switches to the page to show all the possible outcomes. This resulted in a few ID problems, which were solved by using a random ID generator. I also converted the main CSS units from `px` (which I used throughout the project, since it was easier) to `em` so it can be more easily sized.

## My thoughts on the challenge?
The experience with React was much easier and fun than I was expecting. Achieving the desired logic was fairly simple, and a lot of time was used making with the CSS styles and making the CSS code a bit more organized.

The concepts all make a lot of sense now that I finished it, and surely the learning experience was delightful.
